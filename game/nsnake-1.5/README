1) Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

nSnake is a implementation of the classic snake game with textual interface.
It is playable at command-line and uses the nCurses C library for graphics.
The rules are the same of any snake game:

You control a hungry snake and the objective is to eat as many fruits you can.
Each fruit eaten increases it's size by two units.

The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself. Currently,
nSnake has two modes: With Borders and without borders.

To each fruit is given a bonus value, which decreases over time. So the
challenge is to earn the biggest score possible by eating as many fruits as
you can.

Good luck!

10) Credits
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, i want to thank YOU for playing this game. I hope you liked it!

The whole game design, coding, documenting, packaging and testing were all
made by me.

But i didn't do everything! Throughout the nSnake coding, i found very
interesting sources of ideas. Such as games who also uses nCurses for
displaying games. They have simple, short and commented source-codes that
can be used as references to learn C programming.

Special thanks to:

	nInvaders:	A space invaders-like game using ncurses.
		homepage:	http://ninvaders.sourceforge.net
		comments:	"Thanks for the inspiration. If i
		             haven't installed this in first place,
		             i'd never have the idea for nSnake"

	pacman4console: A console-based pacman game.
		homepage:  http://doctormike.googlepages.com/pacman.html
		comments:  "The way this package was organized
		            is incredible. Thanks for the
		            general packaging ideas"

	vadorz: An addicting ncurses space-invaders game.
		homepage:	http://code.google.com/p/vadorz/
		comments:	"This package is awesome, 'cause it
		             uses ncurses AND pdcurses to be able
		             to play in Windows and GNU/Linux"

	snake4: Fruit-eating snake game
		homepage:	http://shh.thathost.com/
		comments:	"Thanks for the Makefile ideas. It's
		             very well-written."

	Text ASCII Art Generator:	Another awesome ASCII text generator
