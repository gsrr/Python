 * 		This is the main documentation page of nSnake. <br />
 * 		It was made for programmers and people who want to understand
 * 		the source code. <br />
 * 		<br />
 * 		Here is the folder and file structure: <br />

 * 		<h2> Description </h2>
 * 		One important objective i kept in mind when coding nSnake,
 * 		was to make the source code as simple as it could be. <br />
 * 		I wished too that this code could be a guide to C programming
 * 		and nCurses learning for beginners.
 * 		<br />
 * 		But with time, the game structure got more complicated; i had
 * 		to break large chunks of code into more manageable files; the
 * 		folder structure wasn't as clean as before; the Makefile got
 * 		bigger and bigger... I kinda lost myself around somewhere.
 * 		<br />
 * 		So now i think this source code may be a guide to people who
 * 		are used to programming, but don't know about coding standards,
 * 		modularization, naming rules, and such. <br />
 * 		Then, if you already have a project (or if you are making one)
 * 		i highly recommend you take a time to read these source files
 * 		and consider at least some of the ideas i present. <br />
 * 		For example, the function names. <br /> <br />
 * 		Each group of .c and .h files represent an unique concept.
 * 		<i>Player, Fruit and Scores</i>, together with <i>Main</i> and
 * 		<i>nSnake</i> itself. Each of those has a responsability on the
 * 		game. <br />
 * 		So i renamed each function to this pattern:
 * 			<div align="center">
 * 			<b> modulename_action_provided_by_function () </b>
 * 			</div>
 * 		<br />
 *		This way, just by looking at it you know where this function is
 * 		from.
 *              Also, this is the structure of external functions - functions
 *              that can be called from other modules. If there is a function
 *              that only serves the current module, it has simply the name
 *              of the action provided by the function.
 *
 *		<b>I really need to continue this description.</b>
